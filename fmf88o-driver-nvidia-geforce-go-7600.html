# Tarkov User Hardware Survey Follow-up --- ##Привет Escapers! This is my follow up post to the basic data I have gathered from my previous post where I asked people to submit some basic hardware to try and make sense in one post of why some players are experiencing bad performance that consequently is making the game unplayable.

So I have been having graphic artifacting with serveral games. Dying Light and 7 days to die are the worse, with that being said I dont get any in Killing floor (could be Directx problem I dont know). So if I rollback my driver I will not get any tearing for hours of playing, however when I turn off the computer for the night and start playing again the artifacting will come back. I will then update the rollbacked driver and it will solve the artifacting, till I restart.

Hey guys, I built my PC about 7 years ago. It still plays most games on medium-high settings, but I'm looking to upgrade again. I know you aren't supposed to build a computer to lost 5-10 years, but with the right upkeep and upgrades I've managed fairly well =) Anyway here's the specs on my old PC if anyone is interested for any reference: Operating System: Windows 2.6.1.7600 CPU Type: AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800 CPU Speed (GHz): 2.22 System Memory (GB): 3.12 Video Card Model. Before I begin, here's an example of the sort of problem I'm having. ( Recently, a conversion box I was using (DVI and 3.5mm to HDMI) crapped out, so I replaced it with this model. ( It works fine sometimes, but periodically the screen will begin to flicker as seen above and continue to get worse until it's no longer tolerable. The monitor So, a neighbor gave my brother an older computer she didn't want anymore. For anyone curious on further specs it's an HP Pavillion m7690n ( It quickly crashed on us while I tried to install Diablo 2, a game I picked up at my local Goodwill. I took it to this awesome shop,my go-to upgrade/repair shop. They diagnosed it as a bad hard drive and video/graphics card. They switched out the NVIDIA GeForce So when I click play it immediately brings up a black screen and it says the application has stopped working. This is what it says in the crash.

I've got a pretty decent computer. It's not horrible but it's really not that great. Here's the specs, as listed via dxdiag: - AMD Sempron Processor 2600+, MMX, 3DNow, ~1.6GHz - 1024 MB RAM - NVidia GeForce 7600 GS, 512MB - Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 I built this PC myself a few years ago, probably around 2003. The OS install is fairly recent, and I know I don't have any viruses. So, now that I've got the machine diagnostic out of the way, here's the problem. Very specific games. 
Hello. I've tried googling for a solution to my conundrum, but to no avail. I've recently connected my laptop to my TV via VGA. This has been generally hitch free, but the resolution is slightly off. I think that it may be a case of the driver not supporting the proper resolution, but I may be mistaken. I'm currently using an Nvidia GeForce Go 7600 graphics card on an old Sony Vaio VGN-FE41Z laptop which is running on Windows 7 (32-bit). The TV is a 22 inch Goodmans LD2245WD widescreen televi. Hi, I recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 on an old VAIO VN-FE41Z as the sole operating system. I'm very pleased with the OS so far, but the screen brightness appears to be broken. The brightness slider does nothing, and the Fn key has also been futile. It appears to have locked itself on maximum brightness, which is far to bright for me. I'm assuming the problem is driver related, but I'm completely new to this OS and have no idea how to fix it. The graphics is an NVIDIA GeForce So the only time my machine gives me any problems are when playing Minecraft and the scan for Windows Experience Index. I recently upgraded to Win 7 Ultimate and added more RAM. Anything would be helpful. I can also provide more information on request. I'm including the system specs here: ------------------ System Information ------------------ Time of this report: 10/6/2014, 13:50:32 Machine name: XYZ-PC Operating System: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service For the past two weeks I've had very inconsistent connection to the internet. I use a laptop, connected to wireless internet. We had someone come out and look at the internet and they changed our modem because it wasn't updated, but it hasn't helped. For a few days this weekend and a few days last week I had thought this problem had gone away, but it's back. I play online games and when these spikes happen people begin to run in place and then rubber-band when the connection speeds Hello guys. I felt like reddit was a better place to ask then on google, as the 0x00000124 error seems to be for all kind of trouble. My computer has been working absolutely fine for the longest time. I had a pretty bad crash a year ago, but solved this my exchanging the MB. Computer has been running fine after that. I decided to try my graphics card as well and my new sound card I just received. (I thought the graphics was wasted as well, but it turned out to be working after some fiddling.). Hi, A friend asked me to repair his laptop an old Toshiba Qosmio F30-112 which, after running Windows Update started reporting a Code 43 (Device cannot start) for its Nvidia Geforce Go 7600 graphics card. Google results turned up several solutions that I tried including: uninstalling current drivers and using Driver Sweep to clean up the leftovers then installing earlier drivers from the nvidia homepage Installing modified drivers Tried changing the AGP Aperture Quick story: Up until today was able to run computer and games just fine. Woke up today, after the BIOS splash and Starting Windows screen, the screen turned black forever. I was able to log in using safe mode to schedule a chkdsk, look at driver versions/try a rollback of video drivers, virus scan, etc. Ended up trying to do a last known good configuration. Nothing worked until I went in to device manager and disabled my video card in safe mode. Then in normal mode everything worked perfectly. Alright, I'll try to be as detailed as possible because I'm sort of lost here on what to do. I have a new computer that's been running perfectly for two months until a few days ago. Now, when I play video games (Such as WoW, FF, Dragon Age) it will run smoothly for awhile and then suddenly my monitors will go black and usually I get a continuous audio stutter. Sometimes my computer will remain on and I'll have to hard restart it, a few times today it just restarted on it's own after a few secon.

I just dont know how I should go about doing it. I'm scared of wasting money or fucking something up. Also. I'm not really sure what part exactly is the processor!?
